# Information-Retrieval-System

We have implemented a simple Search Engine for Amazon-Reviews dataset. The search engine is implemented with an inverted index. The search engine supports boolean query, free text queries, phrase queries. The results are sorted based on TF-IDF. It also consists of a relevance feedback from the user.
